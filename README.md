*DESCRIPTION*:  
The Real-Time Chat Application is a fully functional chat platform developed to enable instant messaging between users. Built using WebSockets along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application facilitates seamless communication in real time. This projectâ€™s primary goal is to provide a simple yet efficient communication tool, making it ideal for collaborative environments, casual chats, or even professional team discussions.

The application connects users to a WebSocket server, where all messages are broadcast to every connected client. Users can type their messages in the input box, and once sent, the message is displayed in the chat box instantly. The chat interface distinguishes between messages sent by the user and those received from others by applying different colors, making it visually clear.

This project emphasizes responsiveness and usability, ensuring that users can easily chat on any device, whether a desktop or a smartphone. The CSS styling enhances readability and adds a modern touch to the interface. Additionally, the WebSocket server ensures reliable message delivery, even in real-time scenarios with multiple participants. This chat application demonstrates the potential of WebSockets in developing efficient, live communication platforms.
