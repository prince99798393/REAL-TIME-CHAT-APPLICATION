*DESCRIPTION*:  
The Interactive Quiz Application is a user-friendly platform that allows users to engage in quizzes, receive instant feedback on their answers, and track their performance in real-time. This application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a seamless and intuitive experience. The main aim of this project is to create a fun yet educational environment where users can test their knowledge in various domains, from general knowledge to specialized fields.

The application dynamically loads questions, ensuring a fresh experience every time it's used. Each question is presented with multiple choices, and users can select their answers. Upon submission, the app provides instant feedback, highlighting whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect. It also displays the correct answer in case of errors, helping users learn and improve. A scoring system is incorporated to track the user's performance, and at the end of the quiz, the final score is displayed with an option to restart the quiz.

This project was developed with clean, responsive design principles. The interface is minimal yet engaging, suitable for users across all age groups. The JavaScript code ensures that the questions load dynamically, avoiding repetition and enhancing the user experience. The platform is also easily extendable, allowing more questions to be added in the future. Overall, this project showcases how interactive design and real-time feedback mechanisms can create a productive learning tool.
